<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>Therefore, we carried out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Gender ?</h2>
<p>The data frame <code>omega</code> contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. We will try to conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives.</p>
<p>We first calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, we show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval</p>

<p>From the summary table, we see that the average, median, min, max and quantile salary results all points to male executives having higher salaries than female ones. Therefore, according to the summary data, it is likely that male executives have significantly higher salary than females ones. From the second data frame, we can see that the 95% CI of male and female executive salaries do not overlap with each other. This indicates that male executives indeed have higher salaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also ran a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money.</p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>

The result male executives having more experience endangers the previous result - male executives have higher salaries. For now it is possible that the salary differences result from experience gap instead gender difference.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Experience ?</h2>
<p>Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.</p>

<p>The group of females as a whole has less experience in work compared to the group of males. And there exists a significant positive correlation between experience and salary both in females and males. Thus, the gap between avarage salary of males and females is mostly caused by the experience difference group.
From the scatterplot, we can see that females with similar experience to males tend to have similar salaries either. We can infer that discrimination is not the major, at least not only factor, that results in the salary difference in the two groups.</p>
